# GithubCrawler #

This simple crawler simply accesses Github APIs to get the information of all the repositories available in public on Github, then stores it in a local MySQL database.

It currently uses [HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html), [JSON-java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java), [JDBC](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html) and [JGit](https://eclipse.org/jgit/).
